> A curated list of awesome LIDAR sensors and its applications.

LIDAR is a remote sensing sensor that uses laser light to measure the surroundings in ~cm accuracy.

## Datasets
- [Oxford RobotCar](https://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk/) - The Oxford RobotCar Dataset contains over 100 repetitions of a consistent route through Oxford, UK, captured over a period of over a year. 
- [EU Long-term Dataset](https://epan-utbm.github.io/utbm_robocar_dataset/) - This dataset was collected with our robocar (in human driving mode of course), equipped up to eleven heterogeneous sensors, in the downtown (for long-term data) and a suburb (for roundabout data) of Montbéliard in France. The vehicle speed was limited to 50 km/h following the French traffic rules.
- [NuScenes](https://www.nuscenes.org/) - Public large-scale dataset for autonomous driving.
